# Mockup Creation

Build implementation-ready mockups that align with backend states, brand guidelines, and design system constraints.

## Workflow

1. Define scope
   - Confirm target screens, user flow, and platform (web/mobile).
   - Identify required states: loading, empty, success, error, and permission-restricted.

2. Map data contract
   - List the API endpoints and response fields each screen depends on.
   - Represent realistic payload sizes and edge cases in the mockup (long text, missing fields, zero-state).

3. Design system and brand alignment
   - Follow `../wireframes/design_language.md` and `../wireframes/brand_guidelines.md`.
   - Use a consistent spacing scale, typography hierarchy, and semantic color usage.

4. Produce mockup package
   - Primary mockup for each screen.
   - Variant mockups for each required state.
   - Annotation layer with:
     - element purpose
     - bound API field(s)
     - interaction behavior
     - validation/error rules

5. Handoff details
   - Include component inventory and reusable tokens.
   - Include interaction notes (hover, focus, disabled, keyboard behavior).
   - Include implementation risks and unanswered product questions.

## Quality Bar

- Every important backend state is represented.
- Critical paths are complete end-to-end.
- Layout and copy are internally consistent.
- Accessibility constraints are represented in the design.
- Specs are actionable for engineering handoff without additional clarification.
